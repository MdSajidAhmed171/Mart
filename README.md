# Mart

Mart is a simple console-based Java application built using pure Core Java (OOP) concepts.
The project simulates a basic shopping system with Users, Admins, Products, and Purchase flow, without using Framwork, databases, or frameworks.

This project focuses on code quality, object-oriented design, and clean architecture, which aligns with Core Java job requirements.
